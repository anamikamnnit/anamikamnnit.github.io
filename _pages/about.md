I am Anamika Shukla. I come from Lucknow, a city in India famous for its cultural history. I completed my BTech in Information Technology from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT).

I work in the fields of Program & Product Management, Technology, HCI & Design. I am passionate about what I do. I like brainstorming, observing, & acquiring the knowledge about new cutting edge technologies. I am not a feminist, though I support multiple Women in Technology initiatives. I believe there is lot that we get from society & believe in Giving back to the society for human welfare.

I help running business units with emphasis on products, design & technology. I possess keen interest for User Experience, Artificial Intelligence, mobility tech & ERP tech. My key skills include program management & strategy, roadmap definition, product management, prototyping & testing, research & analysis, nurture & commercialize products & solutions for different platforms such as AI interfaces, mobile devices & desktops, SAP etc.
