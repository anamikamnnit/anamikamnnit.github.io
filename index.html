I am Prateek Bhagdev. I come from Shahdol, a small town in India. I completed my bachelors degree in Computer Science & Engineering, & Yeah... I dropped out of Electronics & Communication Engineering prior to that.

I work in the fields of Product Management, Design, Technology, HCI & Human Factors. I believe there is lot that we can apply & connect with these fields into this huge universe, & vice versa. I do what I love and I love what I do. I like thinking, observing, & working on ideas whenever have one. I believe in creating opportunities and possibilities in the world by amalgamation of technology and creativity.

Bragging rights: L I’ve been almost shot at while writing a code logic in a 120-degree tent, I’ve made ice-creams out of Water Only, and I’m a pretty good cook :smile:
