I work in the fields of Product Management, Design, Technology, HCI & Human Factors. I believe there is lot that we can apply & connect with these fields into this huge universe & vice versa.

I believe in creating opportunities and possibilities in the world by amalgamation of technology and creativity.

Bragging rights: I’ve been almost shot at while writing code logic in a 120-degree tent, I’ve made ice-creams out of Water Only, and I’m a pretty good cook.
