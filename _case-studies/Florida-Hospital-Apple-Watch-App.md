<h2>Ideation</h2>

<h4>Phase I</h4>
The main idea behind creation of this app was to help user do certain tasks related to itinerary drawn for post treatment follow up care, generate health reports and to view some other health related suggestions on the flick of a wrist.	
We have designed the app in such a way that user could perform various important tasks in a minimalistic way, since its difficult to have intense interactions with smaller screens.
<h4>Phase II</h4>
While conceptualizing the Glances, our main focus was to provide user with less amount of data but with most appropriate & important information.
Some of information from app that could be seen as glances would include the info related to heart rate, recommendations & suggestions as per the recent itinerary drawn for treatment from Florida Hospital and info about the recent future appointments with hospital & its doctors.
While using the internal capability of watch to provide the app with user’s heart rate data, we decided to show some interpretations & suggestions to user as per heart rate.
<h4>Phase III</h4>
Once we were done with the ideation of the most important functions regarding app, we started with the Notifications & other remaining features of the app.
App could provide the notifications importantly regarding Medication, availability of reports etc.
Notifications could play a big role when talk about reminding the user to have & complete his current course of medication as per the recent itinerary drawn for treatment from Florida Hospital and as suggested by related doctor.
Users can take actions on the notifications, which in turn will feed hospital intelligence systems with data of user behavior at various instances. This data could also be utilized while creation of reports for those users/patients.
